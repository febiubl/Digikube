Pak Arief will create the second apps named "DIGIKUBE" as duplicate of existing "KUBE" apps. This DIGIKUBE apps used for our project and trial purpose, so it won't conflicting existing "KUBE" apps. In the future data might be migrated from existing apps to the new one.

DIGIKUBE apps for project simulation and trial purpose, will focus on lambs farming activity.

DIGIKUBE interface will copy KUBE, with additional menu for:

Non-Kube members to buy lambs (similar to OXL marketplace)
Non-kube members to make reservation / order in advance the lambs.
In the scenario of reservation will targeting ASN (civil servants) in Sumedang government office. Contract letter will be formed and down payment or installment transfer to their own name account in Bank Kabupaten Sumedang (BUMD).
For entrepreneurial menu, there will be PIC to select the suitable material links in Youtube / internet.
